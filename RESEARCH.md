Business Cybersecurity Problems: Analysis and Future Directions
Problem 1: Phishing Attacks
Description: Phishing attacks involve impersonating trusted entities to deceive users into revealing sensitive information, such as usernames, passwords, and financial data.

Constraints and Potential Impacts:

Phishing has high adaptability, evolving to bypass standard filters.
Impacts include financial losses, damaged reputation, and compromised data, with potential legal consequences due to data breaches.

Key Facts:

3.4 billion phishing emails are sent daily.
Google blocks around 100 million phishing emails per day.
Phishing remains a dominant cybercrime, particularly impacting organizations in the UK and Asia.

Historical Context: Phishing has been a leading cyber threat with increased sophistication. Early methods, like basic email filters, have shown limited effectiveness against adaptive, AI-enhanced phishing.

Future Challenges: Phishing complexity will likely increase with AI. This requires more advanced detection methods, such as AI-driven anomaly detection to flag suspicious patterns or contexts.

Selected Solution: Develop adaptive AI-based filters using anomaly detection algorithms to preemptively identify phishing patterns. These filters will address the business goal of minimizing exposure to phishing, reducing losses and disruptions associated with phishing breaches.

User Needs and Expectations:

For end-users: Increased protection with minimal false positives in email filtering.
For organizations: Enhanced protection against data breaches without requiring major retraining for employees.
Problem 2: Social Engineering Threats
Description: Social engineering exploits human psychology to elicit sensitive information. With AI advancements, deepfake technology makes impersonation more convincing and hard to detect.

Constraints and Potential Impacts:

Difficulty in distinguishing real interactions from deepfakes.
Impacts include the potential for unauthorized access and fraud, especially where trust is exploited.

Key Facts:

98% of cyberattacks include social engineering.
Organizations experience around 700 social engineering attempts yearly.

Historical Context: Social engineering evolved from phone scams to complex, AI-supported tactics, difficult to identify through traditional awareness training.

Future Challenges: Deepfake and AI-generated personas make traditional detection ineffective. Solutions must consider biometrics (e.g., typing rhythm) and machine learning models for more accurate detection.

Selected Solution: Behavioral biometric verification systems and ML models flagging suspicious interactions. This solution aligns with business objectives by automating response to social engineering threats, supporting both data integrity and user trust.

User Needs and Expectations:

For users: Unobtrusive verification methods like biometric prompts only when unusual behavior is detected.
For organizations: Effective tools that don’t disrupt workflow or create excessive false alarms.
Problem 3: Brute Force Attacks
Description: Brute force attacks use trial-and-error to break passwords. With quantum computing, these attacks could become faster, posing risks to standard encryption.

Constraints and Potential Impacts:

Limited feasibility of defending against quantum-based brute force attacks using traditional encryption.
Impacts include potential breaches of encrypted data, affecting data integrity and confidentiality.

Key Facts:

Brute force attacks cause 5% of data breaches.
Quantum computing will reduce encryption-breaking time.

Historical Context: Encryption like AES and RSA has protected data but is vulnerable to future quantum computing power.

Future Challenges: Post-quantum cryptography will likely be necessary. This requires substantial adoption and investment for effective defense.

Selected Solution: Transitioning to quantum-resistant algorithms will help protect data integrity and meet the business goal of long-term security resilience.

User Needs and Expectations:

For users: Seamless encryption transition with secure password storage and usability.
For organizations: Minimal disruption to data storage processes during encryption transitions.
Problem 4: Human Error
Description: Human error accounts for many cybersecurity incidents, especially through weak password practices or mishandling authentication.

Constraints and Potential Impacts:

Human error cannot be eliminated entirely; training limitations exist.
Impacts include potential breaches due to mismanagement of security protocols, affecting data confidentiality.

Key Facts:

74% of breaches involve human error.
83% of network intrusions are linked to phishing.

Historical Context: Traditional measures like user training and password policies have had limited success.

Future Challenges: Automating security protocols, such as using biometrics, can reduce human error. However, it raises privacy concerns and scalability challenges.

Selected Solution: Automated solutions, including biometric logins, aim to reduce human error while enhancing security and meeting business objectives.

User Needs and Expectations:

For end-users: Effortless security through biometrics and other automated protections.
For organizations: A reduction in human-related breaches with minimal impact on user privacy.
Problem 5: Multifactor Authentication (MFA) Limitations
Description: While MFA adds security layers, it is vulnerable to MFA fatigue, overwhelming users with repeated prompts.

Constraints and Potential Impacts:

MFA usability may reduce user adoption, increasing vulnerability.
Impacts include potential account compromise if users become careless due to “MFA fatigue.”

Key Facts:

MFA blocks 99.9% of automated attacks, but only 13% of SMBs use it consistently.
81% of breaches involve weak or stolen passwords.

Historical Context: MFA adoption sought to enhance security, but tactics like push bombing exploit user fatigue.

Future Challenges: Increasing MFA resilience may involve passwordless systems, physical security keys, and risk-based authentication.

Selected Solution: Risk-based authentication methods analyze device, location, and behavior for adaptive security, balancing user experience and protection goals.

User Needs and Expectations:

For end-users: Reduced authentication prompts while maintaining security.
For organizations: A balance between security and user convenience, reducing fatigue-related vulnerabilities.
