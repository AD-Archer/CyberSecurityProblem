# Implementation

## QR CODE 

### **Project Overview**

The idea is to allow users to generate a unique QR code upon registration, which they can scan with an authenticator app like Google Authenticator. This app will then generate Time-Based One-Time Passwords (TOTP) that users enter during login.

### **Step-by-Step Guide**

#### **1\. Setup Project and Install Libraries**

* Set up a basic Python project using Flask for the backend to handle registration and login.

Install these libraries:  
bash  
Copy code  
`pip install Flask pyotp qrcode[pil]`

*   
* **`pyotp`** is a library for generating TOTP codes.  
* **`qrcode[pil]`** allows us to generate QR codes easily.

#### **2\. Initialize Flask App**

* Start by creating a simple Flask app structure.

python  
Copy code  
`# app.py`  
`from flask import Flask, request, render_template, redirect, url_for`  
`import pyotp`  
`import qrcode`  
`import io`  
`from flask import send_file`

`app = Flask(__name__)`

#### **3\. User Registration and QR Code Generation**

* When a user registers, generate a unique TOTP secret for them.  
* Use the TOTP secret to create a QR code that users can scan.

python  
Copy code  
`users = {}  # In-memory user storage for testing; replace with a database in production`

`@app.route('/register', methods=['GET', 'POST'])`  
`def register():`  
    `if request.method == 'POST':`  
        `username = request.form['username']`  
        `if username in users:`  
            `return "User already exists!", 400`

        `# Generate a TOTP secret for the user`  
        `totp_secret = pyotp.random_base32()`  
        `users[username] = totp_secret`

        `# Generate QR code`  
        `totp_uri = pyotp.totp.TOTP(totp_secret).provisioning_uri(`  
            `name=username, issuer_name="My Secure App"`  
        `)`  
        `qr = qrcode.make(totp_uri)`

        `# Save QR code to in-memory file`  
        `buf = io.BytesIO()`  
        `qr.save(buf, format='PNG')`  
        `buf.seek(0)`

        `# Display QR code on the registration page`  
        `return send_file(buf, mimetype='image/png')`

    `return render_template('register.html')`

* **Explanation**:  
  * `pyotp.random_base32()` generates a secure secret key for TOTP.  
  * `provisioning_uri()` generates a URI that authenticator apps can use.  
  * `qrcode.make()` creates a QR code from the URI.

#### **4\. Login with TOTP Verification**

* Create a login route where users enter their TOTP code.  
* Use `pyotp.TOTP` to verify if the entered code matches the current TOTP.

python  
Copy code  
`@app.route('/login', methods=['GET', 'POST'])`  
`def login():`  
    `if request.method == 'POST':`  
        `username = request.form['username']`  
        `otp = request.form['otp']`

        `if username not in users:`  
            `return "User does not exist!", 400`

        `# Verify TOTP`  
        `totp_secret = users[username]`  
        `totp = pyotp.TOTP(totp_secret)`  
        `if totp.verify(otp):`  
            `return "Login successful!"`  
        `else:`  
            `return "Invalid OTP!", 403`

    `return render_template('login.html')`

* **Explanation**:  
  * `totp.verify(otp)` checks if the user’s entered OTP matches the generated TOTP code.

#### **5\. Create HTML Templates for Registration and Login**

* Create simple HTML templates for user input (`register.html` and `login.html`).

html  
Copy code  
`<!-- register.html -->`  
`<h2>Register</h2>`  
`<form method="post">`  
    `<label for="username">Username:</label>`  
    `<input type="text" id="username" name="username" required>`  
    `<button type="submit">Register</button>`  
`</form>`  
`<p>Scan the QR code that appears after you register with an authenticator app.</p>`

html  
Copy code  
`<!-- login.html -->`  
`<h2>Login</h2>`  
`<form method="post">`  
    `<label for="username">Username:</label>`  
    `<input type="text" id="username" name="username" required><br>`  
    `<label for="otp">Enter OTP:</label>`  
    `<input type="text" id="otp" name="otp" required><br>`  
    `<button type="submit">Login</button>`  
`</form>`

#### **6\. Run the Flask App**

* Run your app locally to test the registration and login flow.

bash  
Copy code  
`flask run`

#### **7\. Testing the App**

* **Register**: Go to `/register`, enter a username, and scan the QR code with an authenticator app.  
* **Login**: After registration, go to `/login` and enter the generated OTP from the app.

### **Extra Tips**

* **Local Storage**: This setup is using a dictionary for storing user data for simplicity. In a production app, replace this with a database.  
* **Token Expiry**: By default, TOTP codes expire after 30 seconds. This can be configured if you need a different duration.  
* **Error Handling**: Add error handling to make it clear to users when registration or login fails.
