### **1\. Phishing Attacks**

* **Description**: Phishing is a common cyber-attack method where attackers impersonate trustworthy entities to steal sensitive information like usernames, passwords, and financial data.  
* **Key Facts**:  
  * 3.4 billion phishing emails are sent daily.  
  * Google blocks around 100 million phishing emails each day.  
  * Phishing accounts for the majority of cybercrime incidents globally, especially against organizations in the UK and Asia.

### **2\. Social Engineering Threats**

* **Description**: Social engineering involves manipulating people into divulging information or performing actions beneficial to attackers. With AI advancements, such as deepfake technology, these attacks are becoming more sophisticated.  
* **Key Facts**:  
  * 98% of cyberattacks involve some form of social engineering.  
  * Organizations face an average of 700 social engineering attacks annually.  
  * AI-driven phishing and deepfakes complicate social engineering attacks further.

### **3\. Brute Force Attacks**

* **Description**: Brute force attacks use trial and error to crack passwords or encryption keys. Emerging technologies, such as quantum computing, can potentially make these attacks faster and more effective.  
* **Key Facts**:  
  * Brute force attacks contribute to 5% of all data breaches.  
  * Quantum computing could accelerate brute force methods, challenging existing security measures.

### **4\. Role of Human Error**

* **Description**: Many cybersecurity incidents result from human error. Errors include falling for phishing scams, poor password management, and mishandling authentication protocols.  
* **Statistics**:  
  * 74% of breaches involve some form of human error.  
  * 83% of network intrusions are linked to phishing attacks.  
  * Removing human involvement through automation could reduce vulnerabilities significantly.

### **5\. Multifactor Authentication (MFA) Limitations**

* **Description**: MFA strengthens security by requiring users to verify identity through multiple methods. However, MFA is not foolproof, and tactics like MFA fatigue (bombarding users with authentication requests) can compromise its effectiveness.  
* **Statistics**:  
  * MFA blocks 99.9% of automated attacks, yet only 13% of SMBs use it consistently.  
  * 81% of breaches involve weak or stolen passwords, highlighting the need for robust MFA policies.

  * [Expert Insights on MFA Statistics](https://expertinsights.com/insights/multi-factor-authentication-statistics/)

### **Problem Statement**

* **Summary**: The evolving landscape of cybersecurity threats—exacerbated by AI and quantum computing—poses significant risks. Common attack methods, including phishing, social engineering, and brute force, are intensified by human error. While multifactor authentication (MFA) provides a layer of security, it alone cannot fully mitigate these threats. Future solutions must address the limitations of current security practices and seek to minimize human involvement in critical security processes.
