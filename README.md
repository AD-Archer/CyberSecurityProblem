## Overview
FortifyNow is a research project focused on understanding and addressing the evolving cybersecurity challenges faced by businesses and individuals. This project explores various types of cyberattacks, their impacts, and potential solutions, aiming to provide insights into mitigating cybersecurity risks effectively.

## Research Focus

### Business Problems
- **Phishing Attacks**: Investigating tactics used by attackers to impersonate trusted entities and steal sensitive data.
- **Social Engineering Threats**: Exploring how advancements in AI have amplified social engineering methods to manipulate individuals.
- **Brute Force Attacks**: Assessing the risks posed by quantum computing on traditional password security.
- **Human Error**: Analyzing the role of human mistakes in breaches and exploring automation as a preventive measure.
- **MFA Limitations**: Examining the strengths and weaknesses of multifactor authentication.

## Goals
Our primary aim is to identify current cybersecurity challenges and explore potential technological solutions, especially those that account for human factors and limitations in current security practices.

## Project Structure and Repositories
To keep the project organized, I decided to split it into three repositories:
1. **[FortifyNow Project Repository](https://github.com/AD-Archer/FortifyNow)**: This is the main project repository, focusing solely on the core implementation.
2. **[Planning Repository](https://github.com/users/AD-Archer/projects/6)**: Contains the implementation plan and roadmap, allowing a clear focus on planning separate from the core project.
3. **[Coding Challenge Repository](https://github.com/AD-Archer/coding-challenge)**: Dedicated to coding challenges associated with the project, keeping them independent from the final code and planning documentation.
