# Project Focus: Password Manager and Additional Concepts

## Introduction

For this project, I've chosen to focus on implementing a **Password Manager**. This solution aims to improve password security by providing an easy-to-use, feature-rich tool for generating, storing, and managing secure passwords across multiple accounts. 

Below, I also explore other possible security solutions that could enhance user authentication practices. These are additional ideas and alternatives for addressing security, but they serve as references rather than primary project goals.

## Solution 1: Password Manager (Chosen Focus)

### Implementation Plan

1. **Define Requirements**
   - **Core Features**:
     - Modules to learn about keeping yourself safe online.
     - Password generation (random, secure passwords).
     - Have I been pwned bulit into site to see if any passwords have been leaked.
   
2. **Technology Stack**
   - **Libraries**: Flask, Tailwind.
   - **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript.
   
3. **Core Functionalities**
   - **User Registration and Authentication**: Registration with hashed passwords and email verification.
   - **Password Generation**: Secure, customizable password generation.
   - **Password Storage and Retrieval**: Encrypted password storage with controlled access.
   - **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**: Time-based OTP using pyotp.
   
4. **User Interface Design**: Clean, intuitive UI
   
   
5. **Deployment**: Hosted on a cloud service, with production database setup.

6. **Future Enhancements**:
   - Features like breach detection, password strength analysis, and potential browser extension.

## Additional Concepts (Ideas)

### 1. Passwordless Authentication with Email-Based One-Time Passcodes (OTP)

#### Overview
A login system that eliminates password storage by sending one-time passcodes to the user's email, allowing secure authentication.

#### Technology Stack
- **Backend**: Python with Flask/FastAPI for OTP generation and email handling.
- **Frontend**: HTML/CSS, JavaScript for form handling.

#### Steps
1. Generate a unique, time-limited OTP for each login request.
2. Send the OTP via a free email service like Gmailâ€™s SMTP server.
3. Validate the OTP to grant access.

#### Learning Points
Secure email sending, RESTful APIs, and JavaScript-based form handling.

### 2. Two-Factor Authentication App Using QR Codes and TOTP

#### Overview
A 2FA system where users scan a QR code with an authenticator app to get a time-based code for login.

#### Technology Stack
- **Backend**: Python with Flask/FastAPI for TOTP and QR code generation.
- **Frontend**: HTML/CSS/JavaScript to display QR codes and manage OTP submission.

#### Steps
1. Generate TOTP codes using pyotp.
2. Create a QR code for the user to scan.
3. Validate the TOTP for login security.

#### Learning Points
2FA principles, TOTP generation, and QR code creation.

### 3. Behavior-Based Login System (Python & JavaScript)

#### Overview
An additional authentication layer that tracks typing speed or mouse patterns, flagging unusual activity.

#### Technology Stack
- **Backend**: Python with Flask for behavioral data processing.
- **Frontend**: HTML/CSS/JavaScript for data collection.

#### Steps
1. Capture typing speed or mouse patterns.
2. Store baseline patterns and compare during login.

#### Learning Points
Frontend data processing, basic data analysis, and JSON handling.

### 4. Device-Based Authentication with Browser Fingerprinting

#### Overview
Authenticate users by recognizing trusted devices through browser fingerprinting.

#### Technology Stack
- **Backend**: Python with Flask for managing device fingerprints.
- **Frontend**: JavaScript for device information collection.

#### Steps
1. Collect unique device details like IP, screen size, and browser type.
2. Hash this information to create a unique fingerprint.
3. Validate the device fingerprint during login.

#### Learning Points
Device fingerprinting, hashing, and device-trust management.
