Project Focus: Password Manager and Additional Concepts
Introduction
For this project, I've chosen to focus on implementing a Password Manager to improve password security by providing an easy-to-use, feature-rich tool for generating, storing, and managing secure passwords across multiple accounts. Below, I also explore additional security solutions as ideas for future expansion of user authentication practices. These alternative solutions offer insights but are not primary project goals.


Solution 1: Password Manager (Chosen Focus)
Implementation Plan
Define Requirements

Core Features:
Educational modules on safe online practices.
Password generation for secure, random passwords.
Integration of "Have I Been Pwned" to check for compromised passwords.

Technology Stack

Libraries: Flask for backend, Tailwind for UI design.
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript.

Core Functionalities

User Registration and Authentication: Includes hashed passwords, email verification, and user-friendly registration flows.
Password Generation: Customizable, secure password generation options.
Password Storage and Retrieval: Encrypted storage and controlled retrieval.
Two-Factor Authentication (2FA): Time-based OTP using pyotp library.

User Interface Design

Focus on an intuitive and clean UI that promotes ease of use.

Deployment: Hosted on a cloud service with production-ready database configurations.

Future Enhancements

Potential features: breach detection, password strength analysis, browser extension for in-browser password management.
Constraints and Potential Impacts
Constraints: Limited budget and storage options restrict server capacity for managing encrypted data at scale.
Potential Impacts: Enhanced security for user accounts, reduced likelihood of breaches due to strong passwords, and improved password hygiene for users.
Learning Points
Encryption techniques for password security.
API integration with "Have I Been Pwned."
Design principles for a secure, accessible UI.


Additional Concepts (Ideas)
1. Passwordless Authentication with Email-Based One-Time Passcodes (OTP)
Overview
A login system that eliminates stored passwords by sending one-time passcodes to the userâ€™s email for secure authentication.
Technology Stack
Backend: Python with Flask/FastAPI for OTP handling.
Frontend: HTML/CSS, JavaScript for form handling.
Steps
Generate a unique, time-sensitive OTP for each login.
Send OTP via Gmail SMTP server or similar service.
Validate OTP to grant secure access.
Constraints and Potential Impacts
Constraints: Dependence on third-party email providers; increased risk if email is compromised.
Potential Impacts: Reduces reliance on passwords, thereby lowering the risk of password-related breaches.
Learning Points
Secure email transmission, RESTful API design, and OTP validation techniques.


2. Two-Factor Authentication App Using QR Codes and TOTP
Overview
A 2FA system that uses QR codes and time-based OTP (TOTP) for secure login, with codes generated in an authenticator app.
Technology Stack
Backend: Python with Flask/FastAPI for TOTP generation and QR code generation.
Frontend: HTML/CSS, JavaScript for QR code display and OTP submission handling.
Steps
Generate TOTP using pyotp.
Display a QR code for user scanning.
Verify the TOTP code during login.
Constraints and Potential Impacts
Constraints: Requires users to install authenticator apps, adding setup complexity.
Potential Impacts: Stronger security through two-factor authentication, reducing the impact of password compromises.
Learning Points
TOTP generation, QR code creation, and integration of 2FA with existing login flows.


3. Behavior-Based Login System (Python & JavaScript)
Overview
A security feature that verifies identity by tracking user typing speed or mouse movement, flagging unusual behavior patterns.
Technology Stack
Backend: Python with Flask for handling behavioral data.
Frontend: HTML/CSS, JavaScript for data collection and analysis.
Steps
Capture and record baseline typing speed or mouse patterns.
Compare captured data during login to flag anomalies.
Constraints and Potential Impacts
Constraints: Limited accuracy in recognizing behavioral patterns, making false positives possible.
Potential Impacts: Adds an extra layer of verification, useful for high-security environments, though might not be suited to general usage due to variability in typing/movement patterns.
Learning Points
Data collection from frontend inputs, basic data analysis, and the potential of behavioral biometrics for authentication.


4. Device-Based Authentication with Browser Fingerprinting
Overview
Authenticate users by recognizing trusted devices using browser fingerprinting, adding an extra layer of verification.
Technology Stack
Backend: Python with Flask for fingerprint management.
Frontend: JavaScript for device data collection.
Steps
Gather device details like IP, screen size, and browser type.
Create a unique hash from device information.
Use this fingerprint for device-based validation.
Constraints and Potential Impacts
Constraints: May not work well with users on multiple devices; privacy concerns may limit fingerprinting usage.
Potential Impacts: Adds security by verifying device consistency, but may lead to privacy and compatibility issues with different browsers.
Learning Points
Device fingerprinting techniques, privacy considerations, and device-trust management practices.
